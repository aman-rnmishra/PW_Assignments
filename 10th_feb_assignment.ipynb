    "\n",
    "1. 'r' (Read Mode): This mode is used to open an existing file for reading purposes. If the file doesn't exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'w' (Write Mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, it will truncate it to zero-length. If it does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'a' (Append Mode): This mode is used to open a file for writing in such a way that it doesn't overwrite the existing content. Instead, it appends new content to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode): This mode is used to open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, it will raise a FileExistsError.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like images and executable files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 't' (Text Mode): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is used for text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. '+' (Update Mode): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing. It is typically used for updating a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "These modes can be combined to create more specific file opening behaviors, such as rb (read in binary mode) or w+ (write and read mode)."

    "The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. It is important to close a file after it has been opened because it frees up system resources that were being used to keep the file open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving a file open for a long time can cause system performance issues because it ties up resources that could be used by other applications or processes. Additionally, any changes made to a file while it is open may not be written to the file until it is closed, which can result in data loss or corruption if the program crashes or is interrupted before the file is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also ensures that any data that was buffered in memory is written to the file, so that it is available for other programs to read. If a file is not closed, any changes made to it may not be visible to other programs until the file is closed or the system is rebooted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, closing a file with the close() function is important to release system resources, ensure data integrity, and make any changes made to the file available to other programs."
